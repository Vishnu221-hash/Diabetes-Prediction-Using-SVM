The result of the model is whether the person is diabetic or not. The model takes features such as number of Pregnancies,Glucose,Blood Pressure,Insulin Levels,BMI,Diabetees Pedigree Function and the age of the person to predict the outcome.I have used a SVM Supervised Machine Learning algorithm here.
